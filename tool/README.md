# @xlengelle-sf/agentforce-tool

A MCP tool for integrating Claude Desktop with Salesforce Agentforce.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @xlengelle-sf/agentforce-tool -g
```

## Usage

### Configuration

You can configure the tool in two ways:

#### 1. Interactive CLI (Recommended)

The tool now features an interactive CLI that will prompt you for all required configuration values:

```bash
# Using the global installation
agentforce-tool

# or using npx
npx @xlengelle-sf/agentforce-tool
```

When you run the tool for the first time, it will ask for:
- Server URL (defaults to http://localhost:3000/api)
- Tool Port (defaults to 3001)

The values will be saved to a `.env` file for future use. The tool will automatically load this configuration file on subsequent starts.

#### 2. Manual Configuration

Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file manually with the following variables:

```env
# Tool Configuration
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
TOOL_PORT=3001
```

### Port Already in Use

If you see an error about the port already being in use, you can specify a different port:

```bash
# Run with a different port
TOOL_PORT=3002 agentforce-tool
```

## Configuring Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Tools
3. Add a new tool with the following configuration:
   - Tool URL: `http://localhost:3001` (or the URL where the tool is running)
   - Tool Name: `agentforce`

## Using with Claude Desktop

Once configured, you can use the tool with Claude Desktop:

```
Can you help me use the agentforce tool to talk to my Salesforce agent?
```

Claude will create a session with your Agentforce agent and enable you to exchange messages.

## Streaming Support

This tool supports real-time streaming responses, providing a more interactive experience. When Claude uses the streaming mode, it will receive responses in real-time as they're generated by the Agentforce agent.
